 * WINE:
   * It's assumed you have an empty WINE environment. Installed software in an existing WINE enviroment may cause conflicts during the installation steps below.
   * The following instructions were tested with WINE verion 0.9.9. Your mileage with other version will likely vary.
 * You'll also need to get and install [http://www.kyz.uklinux.net/cabextract.php cabextract].

=Setup=

 # Set WINE's Windows version to Windows 2000 (or above), and add an override to use the native itss.dll, both via winecfg: 
{{{
wine winecfg
}}}
 # Download [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp Microsoft HTML Help Workshop] and  install it as: 
{{{
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="advpack=n" wine htmlhelp.exe
}}}
 # Install ITSS.DLL as: 
{{{
cabextract -d htmlhelp htmlhelp.exe
cabextract -d hhupd htmlhelp/hhupd.exe
cp -a hhupd/itss.dll ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/
}}}
 # Download [http://download.microsoft.com/download/sql65/Patch/6.5/WIN98/EN-US/MFC40i.exe Microsoft Foundation Classes update], extract it, and install it as:
