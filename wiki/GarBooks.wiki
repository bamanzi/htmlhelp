= About the GAR system =

The books are built using the [http://www.lnx-bbc.com/garchitecture.html GAR system] -- a mechanism for automating the compilation and installation of third-party source code developed for the [http://www.lnx-bbc.com/ LNX-BBC project]. 

Here it is used to automate the download the sources, extract, patch, configure or build if necessary, and finally convert the documentation into the desired formats.

= Requirements =

To build all the books you will need:
 * A POSIX environment, such as [http://www.debian.org/ Linux] or [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin].
 * [http://docbook.sourceforge.net/ DocBook XSL and DSSSL Stylesheets]
 * [http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/ xsltproc]
 * [http://www.doxygen.org/ Doxygen]
 * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp Microsoft HTML Help SDK] to build CHM.
 * [HHW4Wine Wine] to run the Microsoft HTML Help compiler above, if not building under Windows.

= Download =

You can download the source from its [http://htmlhelp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/garbooks/ Subversion repository]:
{{{
svn co http://htmlhelp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/garbooks/
}}}
