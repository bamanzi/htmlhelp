The [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp  Microsoft HTML Help 1.3 SDK] is the official way to create CHM's. The HTML Help Compiler (HHC) takes a HTML Help Project (HHP) file with metadata, a HTML Help Contents (HHC) with the table of contents, and a HTML Help Index (HHK) with the index keywords, and the HTML pages, producing a CHM.

[http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/hhm/ HTML Help Maker] is an open-source project which plans to allow the creation of CHM's

Many open-source tools automatically generate the HHP, HHC, and HHK together with the HTML output. Especially worth noting are:

=Format=

Microsoft never released the format specification, but there are a few reverse engineered descriptions of the format:

 * [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/chmspec Unofficial CHM Specification]
 * Matthew Russotto's [http://www.speakeasy.org/~russotto/chm/chmformat.html Microsoft's HTML Help format] description

There are some tools which allow to read the contents of CHM files:
